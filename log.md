# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Saturday 24 Nov, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started curriculum on https://www.freecodecamp.com. Forked and cloned the 100 days of code GitHub repository.

**Thoughts:** The curriculum is probably not for me. I should focus on something more productive.

### Day 1: Saturday 25 Nov, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a simple Angular application for coding tools

**Thoughts:** I've decided to write create some simple tools form myself. These include binary and hexadecimal number converters among others. I frequently find myself searching the web for these tools and it would be nice to have them all in one place.

**Today's Progress**: I have been looking at inputmask to restrict user input numbers in Angular forms

### Day 3: Wednesday 28 Nov, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've completed my number conversion example with #Angular. I'll probably make it available online tomorrow.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
